# node-safari

Lets go on a node safari! 🐪 🙈

It's uncertain where this trek will take us, but we will try to strike a balance between instructional material, history, and philosophies on node, javascript, software, programming, engineering, communication, and tooling.

## Required Provisions

* A computer 💻 (hopefully running a flavor of unix)
  * OS X will be easiest to use
  * Linux and windows are a bit more difficult
* Internet and a browser 📞
* some time and interest 🙇

We will be acquiring items and tools along the way.

## Company and Timeline

Getting through all the material is going to take time.  Visit the places that seem most interesting, and don't get stuck on something you find boring or overwhelming.  Programming is [more fun and effective as a hobby](https://twitter.com/substack/status/586438480164589568) and you will learn more if you treat it that way.

Don't go at it alone.  Get in touch with your local javascript and node community and make friends.  Don't live near anyone?

There is a vibrant and active community that is on-line at all hours of the day so you can [remain isolated but still be connected with thousands of people](http://bret.io/2015/05/23/thousand-isolation-d/).



## Getting started.

Before we get started, we need to be somewhat prepared to face what lies ahead.  In order to communicate with the local populous you need to learn how to speak javascript

### [Javascript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com)
If your a cat, like to have fun or learn like a cat, this will teach you the basics of javascript. A+

### [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript)
If you tend to be a bit more serious, Codecademy's Javascript is also a good place to start.  Don't feel bad if you get bored and don't finish.  It's picking up the syntax that counts. B+
